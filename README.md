# pwned-pw-download

Download the pwned password database into a 4 level tree.

It takes about 25 minutes to download the tree.

The tree contains 4369 directories and 1048576 files
not including the `curl.out` diagnostic files.


## TL;DR

To use, we suggest:

```sh
./pwned-pw-download -v 3 pwned.password.tree
```


## Usage

```
usage: ./pwned-pw-download [-h] [-v level] [-V] [-a] [-d] [-p parallel] [-U BASE_RANGE_URL] topdir

    -h          print help message and exit
    -v level    set verbosity level (def level: 0)
    -V          print version string and exit

    -a          do not append a final newline to downloaded files (def: do)
    -d          do not un-DOS downloaded files (def: convert using /opt/homebrew/bin/dos2unix)
    -p parallel curl(1) files up to parallel at a time (def: 64)
    -U base_url curl(1) files from under base_url (def: https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range)

    topdir      top of the 4-level pwned password tree to form

    NOTE: It takes about 25 minutes to download the tree.

    NOTE: The tree contains 4369 directories and contains 1048576 files
          not including files such as curl.out and the top level repo files.

Exit codes:
     0         all OK
     2         -h and help string printed or -V and version string printed
     3         command line error
     4         bash version is too old
     5         cannot make some directory under topdir
     6         some curl command exited non-zero
     7         some dos2unix command exited nonzero, or dos2unix command not found
 >= 10         internal error

pwned-pw-download version: 1.2 2024-12-18
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: As of 2024-Dec-17, the original files from
[https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range](https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range)
are in "_DOS_" format and they lack a final newline character.
The `pwned-pw-download` tool assumes that you prefer a more modern file
format and converts the files using the `dos2unix(1)` utility.  Should you
prefer the original file format, use both `-d -a` on the command line.


## Why a 4 level tree

The `pwned-pw-download.sh` shell script will download the entire dataset used by
[HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) into a 4 level directory tree.

Unlike some downloads, this will will NOT form a huge directory, which for many
file systems is not very efficient.  Instead, we form a 4 level tree where
the bottom level directors contain only 256 files each, plus a `curl.out' file
for diagnostic purposes.


## Pwned password tree layout

The pwned password tree has 4 levels.  Files are of the form:

```
i/j/k/ikjxy
```

where i, j, k, x, y are UPPER CASE hex digits:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
```

Each file is of the form:

```
35-UPPER-CASE-HEX-digits, followed by a colon (":"), followed by an integer > 0
```

For eample, all pwned passwords with a SHA-1 that begin with `12345` will be found in:

```
1/2/3/12345
```

NOTE: The first 1 SHA-1 HEX characters are duplicated in the 3 directory levels.



## Example: a line from 1/2/3/12345

The `1/2/3/12345` contains the following line:

```
00772720168B19640759677862AD5350374:4
```

The SHA-1 hash of the pwned password is the 1st 5 HEX digits from the file,
plus the 35 hex digits of the line before the colon (":").  Thus the
SHA-1 hash of the pwned password is:

```
1234500772720168B19640759677862AD5350374
```

The `4` after the colon (":") means that the given password has been pwned at
least 4 times and should **NOT** be used.


## Example: Lookup password in the tree

Consider the password:

```
password
```

The SHA-1 hash of "`password`" is:

```
5BAA61E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8
```

Using the first 5 hex digits, open the file:

```
5/B/A/5BAA6
```

Look for the remaining 35 hex digits followed by a `:`:

```sh
grep -F 1E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8: 5/B/A/5BAA6
```

This will produce the line:

```
1E4C9B93F3F0682250B6CF8331B7EE68FD8:10437277
```

This indicates that the password "`password`", has been pwned at least 10437277 times!
